# Hello World! I am Carol

#### a Brazilian developer passionate about technology and computing üíª

## ‚ú® About me:

With over 4 years of XP, I currently work as a Front-end Developer at Leo Burnett, where I am part of the One.Bra team, dedicated exclusively to serving Bradesco. I have been responsible for several key deliveries on the client‚Äôs HUB, and a few weeks ago, I was invited to join the Change the Bank squad, an important and recently implemented project.

I studied Computer Science at UFPEL, which provided me with a solid foundation in programming logic and data structures. Additionally, I often work on personal projects that allow me to refine specific skills.

I am a problem-solving enthusiast, which drives me to continuously learn and grow. I am collaborative, assertive, and adaptable, enabling me to build extensive knowledge across various tools and technologies. At the same time, I prioritize effectively and remain focused on what truly matters.

I am also interested in game development, astrophysics, and reading. In my free time, I enjoy playing the bass guitar.
